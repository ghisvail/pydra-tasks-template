#This workflow will install Python dependencies, run tests and lint with a variety of Python versions

# Note that editable installs of Pydra and the task package is useful to ensure that the
# template describes namespace packages that can be used in various development environments.
# Packages that use it probably do not want to continue testing with editable installations,
# quadrupling their test load.
